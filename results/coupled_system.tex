\section{Coupled System}

\color{blue}
To test if the constituent parts of the coupled system still works we first set $v_c = 0$ and hope to see the same results as with the isolated systems. (maybe totally unnecessary to mention this. I guess the paper should assume the code works and shouldn't go into detail on the testing)
