\section{Coupled System}

\subsection{Testing}
Before we investigate the effects of increasing the coupling strength between the two systems, we verify that if the hopping amplitude $v_c = 0$, the spectra on the individual sites remain unchanged. For the coupled system, calculating the Lehmann spectrum is no longer an option as memory becomes a limiting factor, instead we resort to using the Green's function method.

\medskip
As can be seen when comparing Fig. \ref{fig:coupled_vc_0} with the spectra in Fig. \ref{fig:spectrum_engineering} and Fig. \ref{fig:isolated_benzene}, this is indeed the case. The slight variations being due to a difference in parameters used to perform the Fourier transformation.

No text yet, just some graphs showing what my results are roughly looking like. For final graphs I could choose more fitting parameters

Just to show what graphs I can produce. Parameters chosen should proably be adjusted. Bottom right is interesting though. Even though light only hits QD, allowing hoppings to benzene causes the potentail energy to remain high after the pulse vanishes. Not the case for QD only. Would be useful to see Potential energy for each site, but not possible with current implementation in the code}}
