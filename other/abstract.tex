\begin{changemargin}{1.5cm}{1.5cm}

Solar power is one of the most promising low carbon energy technologies, allowing electricity generation from free and abundant sunlight. With ever-increasing energy demands on top of the looming threat of a climate crisis, innovations in this field are essential. However, progress in conventional silicon-based solar cell technologies has begun to stagnate as they approach their inherent maximum efficiency of $34\%$, the Shockley-Queisser-limit \cite{shockley_queisser}. Among a few other proposed alternatives, heterostructures of transition metal oxides may present a solution to this problem, as they display an effect called ``impact ionisation''.

\smallskip

This thesis builds upon previous works \cite{innerberger, worm_bachelor, prauhart, worm_project}, which have implemented the Hubbard model to investigate impact ionisation in a small cluster of atoms within oxide heterostructures being excited by a short light pulse. We expand the capabilities of the existing code to include non-local Coulomb interactions and set up the framework needed to allow the investigation of impact ionisation in a system consisting of a quantum dot coupled to a benzene ring.
This is motivated by the experimental work \cite{qd_motivation}, where impact ionisation was observed in a similar system.
The benzene ring is modelled as a mono-atomic chain with periodic boundary conditions, and the non-local Coulomb interactions are calculated via the Pariser-Parr-Pople method.
