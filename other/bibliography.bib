author = {Robert J Bursill and Christopher Castleton and William Barford},
abstract = {We obtain a parametrisation of the Pariser–Parr–Pople model of the π-conjugated systems which is optimal for benzene, biphenyl and poly(para-phenylene). We first optimise agreement with experiment for a number of low-lying excitations of benzene, leading to a phenyl transfer integral of 2.539 eV, an on-site Coulomb energy of 10.06 eV and a relative error of 2.8\%, compared with 7.4\% using the standard values. We next optimise agreement for the long axis polarised optical transitions of biphenyl with absorption data, leading to a bridging bond transfer integral of 2.22 eV.}

abstract = {The detailed balance limit for solar cells presented by Shockley and Queisser in 1961 describes the ultimate efficiency of an ideal p–n junction solar cell illuminated by a black body with a surface temperature of 6000K. Today the AM 1.5G spectrum is the standard spectrum for non-concentrated photovoltaic conversion, taking light absorption and scattering in the atmosphere into account. New photovoltaic materials are investigated every day, but tabulated values to estimate their performance limits are difficult to find. Here values of the maximum short circuit current density (Jsc), open circuit voltage (Voc), light to electric power conversion efficiency (η) as well as current density (Jmpp) and voltage (Vmpp) at the maximum power point are presented as a function of the light absorbers’ band gap energy.}
