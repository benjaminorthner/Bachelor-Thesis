\section{Quantum Dot}

Quantum dots (QD) are nanoscopic semiconducting particles that display interesting quantum mechanical effects. Due to their small size, the energy levels of the electrons within them become quantized, much like in atoms. Unlike atoms however, the size of QDs can be chosen arbitrarily, making their absorption spectra highly tunable.  Together with cost-effective manufacturing processes this makes QDs an enticing candidate for new photovoltaic technologies.
\medskip

Their high efficiency in energy conversion has been shown experimentally, and impact ionisation has been proposed as an explanation \cite{impact_io_in_qd}. In this work we first implement a quantum dot into our model, and investigate whether it can facilitate impact ionisation. Subsequently we couple the quantum dot to a larger molecule, benzene in this case, and investigate the effect of this on impact ionisation. This is motivated by the experimental work done in [{\color{red} I can not find this paper}] where impact ionisation was seen in such a system.

\subsection{Geometry}
 
 In implementing quantum dots, one of two choices had to be made. Either we implement a new type of site, with multiple energy levels, or we model the quantum dot as a particular arrangement of sites, which we engineer to have the desired effective energy levels. The latter option requires less alterations to the existing code and thus is that was chosen. In this implementation the hoppings between sites correspond to energy level transitions.
 
 \medskip
 
 For all computations done in this work the QD is modelled as a $2\times 2$ lattice of sites. The hopping amplitudes for horizontal and vertical hoppings were chosen to be $v_h = v_v = 1.0$ and diagonal hoppings $v_d = 0$. Non-local coulomb interactions also calculated with PPP model (see section \ref{subsec:ppp})and distances were calculated by assuming lattice constant was same as $C-C$ bond length ($\SI{1.4}{\angstrom}$). Not physical but we are just looking for proof of concept for now.

 \subsection{Light pulse direction and hopping time dependence}
For every geometry, it is necessary to define a function that explicitly determines whether or not the hopping amplitude $v_{ij}$ between two any two sites $i$ and $j$ is time dependent, i.e. is modified by the light pulse.
\medskip

This depends on the direction of the light pulse, which for our implementation is always along the diagonal coming from the top left. Any hoppings perpendicular to the pulse direction will remain constant over time and are thus not time dependent.
\medskip

The sign of the imaginary parts of the hopping amplitudes is positive for hoppings parallel to the pulse direction and negative for hoppings perpendicular to the pulse direction. By labelling the sites in lexicographical order as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:qd_hoppings} we ensure that all hoppings from sites $i\to j$ have the same sign as $(j-i)$. The positive direction of the imaginary part of the hopping amplitudes are indicated in Fig. \ref{fig:qd_hoppings} by arrowheads.
